### Add package to your project

Add the package with this URL: https://github.com/Deewens/2D-Inventory-System.git?path=/Packages/me.deewens.2d.inventorysystem

### Set up the Inventory
You can give an Inventory to any entity of your game and the procedure is pretty simple.
1. Select the Entity **(GameObject or Prefab)** you want to add the **Inventory** to
2. Add the **Inventory Manager** script to your Entity

   1. Enter a name and a description  
   2. You should give an icon to your item for it to be displayed in the UI, the Icon should be a sprite  
   3. The Prefab property will be explained next  
3. Create a new Prefab in your Project and add it a **Sprite Renderer**
   1. Add the item **icon** to the Sprite Renderer if you want (the icon will be set by the script anyway)
   2. Add the script called **Item** to your Prefab
